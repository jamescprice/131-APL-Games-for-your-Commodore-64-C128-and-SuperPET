Symmetries of the firing squad sychronization problem revealed in a nested array
Pages 19–27

ABSTRACT
The firing squad problem of automata theory is described and a simple, nonoptimal solution is given. Examination of output traces shows that the solution has at least 
one obvious symmetry. If the transition matrix is reshaped and partitioned, the resulting nested array not only reveals and explicates more symmetries but suggests ways
in which nested arrays can be used to save space.
