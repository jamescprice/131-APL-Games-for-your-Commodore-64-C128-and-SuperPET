**131 Games for Your Commodore 64, C128, and SuperPET with APL Source Code**

The Commodore 64 and 128 games are on the c64gamesapl.d64 disk. These are used with APL/Z, run from CP/M as APL.COM. Once APL is loaded, load the game workspaces.   )lib  will show the workspaces and )load workspace  to load a given workspace. When the workspace is loaded use )fns to show the functions you may run.

The Commodore SuperPET games are on the aplgames.d80, aplgames2.d80, aplgames3.d80 disks. These are used by loading the game workspaces in after you run Waterloo microSystems APL from the languages menu.
